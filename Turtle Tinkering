# The-ChooChoo-Project
The Magnum Opus of our careers
Keep it clean.

Station code 
-using advanced turtles

Stone bricks and design bricks are placed down to creat station. 
Stations are built at the ends of the railway


Track code
-using advanced turtles
Powered track is placed in straight sections while iron rail is used for turn sections
Track is place according to the protype layout (see Project Page for details)
-reverse codes were written to reposition the turtle
